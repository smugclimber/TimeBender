# Time BenderTimeBender is a React VR application. A game of repairing time, where you the user is anonymously contacted by a crazed scientist who has disrupted the space time continuum. Enjoy!
## Getting Started

To begin you must start 2 servers. 

NPM run dev in the main folder 

NPM start in the client/VRContent folder
